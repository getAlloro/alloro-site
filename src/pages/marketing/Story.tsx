            I spent five years inside specialist service businesses
            watching incredibly talented people struggle with a
            problem that had nothing to do with their craft.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#212D40]/80 leading-relaxed">
            They were excellent at their craft. The businesses around
            them, the referral relationships, the local visibility,
            the competitive dynamics, the things that determined
            whether they grew or slowly declined, were speaking
            a language nobody translated for them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#212D40]/80 leading-relaxed">
            They hired agencies. They got reports. The reports didn't
            tell them what to do. The agencies charged regardless.
            The problem persisted.

            I served in the United States Air Force. When I got out,
            I had a 100% service-connected disability rating and no
            idea what came next.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#212D40]/80 leading-relaxed">
            What came next was ten years in the local service business
            space, first as an operator, then building the product
            I wish had existed when I was trying to help businesses
            understand what their own data was saying.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#212D40]/80 leading-relaxed">
            I'm not a dentist. I'm not a software engineer. I'm
            someone who lived inside the problem long enough to
            understand it from the inside, then built the solution
            from the outside.

            Alloro exists because 34 million people started a
            business to get their life back. Most of them are
            still waiting.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base text-[#212D40]/80 leading-relaxed">
            The ones who built something worth building deserve
            the intelligence layer to protect it, grow it, and
            eventually hand it to someone who matters, whether
            that's a successor, a buyer, or their own kid.

            That's what Business Clarity means. Not a dashboard.
            Not a report. The confidence that comes from knowing
            which referral source went quiet last month, which
            competitor just opened near you, and what to do about
            both before Monday morning.
