          <p>
            Corey Wise served in the United States Air Force.
            He carries a 100% service-connected disability rating.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a decade, he worked inside specialty service businesses,
            watching brilliant people lose businesses they'd spent their careers building.
            Not because they weren't talented.
            Because they couldn't see what was happening until it was too late.
          </p>
          <p>
            For years before Alloro existed, he taught webinars for veteran entrepreneurs.
            For free. Before there was anything to sell.
          </p>
          <p className="font-semibold text-[#212D40] text-lg">
            Alloro is not an idea he had.
            It is the tool he spent a decade wishing someone would build.
          </p>
          <p>He built it.</p>
          <p>
            The Heroes & Founders Foundation is not a marketing program.
            It is the formalization of work that was already being done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alloro is built on Claude, Anthropic's AI model,
            because Anthropic refused a Department of Defense surveillance contract
            to protect user data. Alloro made the same choice.
            You build with the companies whose values match yours.

            He is building Alloro because the butterfly effect is real.

            The business owner who opens Monday morning with clarity
            pays for the coffee of the person behind them in the drive-thru.
            That person smiles at the checkout teller.
            The teller takes that home.
