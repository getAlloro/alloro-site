            If you spent years in service before you built
            something, in the military, in medicine, in public
            service, in the trades, you are a Hero. You chose
            others before you chose yourself. The business you
            built is the second chapter of that choice. It deserves
            to succeed.

            If you took the leap, left the security of a
            salary, bet on yourself, opened a business or a firm or
            a studio, you are a Founder. Most people won't do what
            you did. The business you built is proof of that.
